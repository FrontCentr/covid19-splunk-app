# covid19-splunk-app
COVID-19 Dashboards and Analytics. Built for Splunk.

Uses COVID-19 aggregate data from Johns Hopkins University (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

## Installation Notes:
Currently, this splunk app expects the covid-19 data (from JHU) to be placed in the directory "C:\Github". This can be modified in inputs.conf.

## To Do:
Add a built-in python script that automatically pulls the covid-19 git data daily from @CSSEGISandData.
